Instead of just creating Frontend, i have developed a functionable Full Stack (MERN) Website.

I have tried to create a Reception Model, where he/she can schedule the task.

Later, we can create a Staff Model where staff can accept the task and change the status of the task accordingly, and User Model where User can complaint and give ratings.

Tech Stack: MERN
CSS Framework: Material UI
